                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                <p>I think that one of my biggest strenghts is that I can think calmly about things even in stressfull situations.
                    that way my concluion isn't made up in a hurry and most of the times very logical. An other big strength of mine is
                    that I am reliable when someone expects something of me. I always make sure I did what I needed to do so that it isn't 
                    my foult when something goes wrong.

                <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                <p>A big weakness of mine is independency, somethimes I count just a little bit to much on others. 
                   in some people's point of view is that a good thing because it means that you trust others, but in my
                   opinion it means that i am not mature enough to handle my own problems.

                <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                <p> I see a big opportunitie in developing and improve my coding skills at the HZ wich helps me choocing the right direction of IT.</p>

                <h2>Threats</h2>
                <p>My biggest threat is not keeping up with my projects. I often have the tendency to slack of a bit and postpone the 
                    things i should have done wich makes me behind schedule and gets me in even deeper problems. </p>
