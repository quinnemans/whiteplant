        Welcome on the page of my first feedback. Here I will<br>
        explain what kind of feedback I received and how Implemated It.<br>
        The first person who came to me to give me feedback was Hugo A.K.A my Studie Career Coach (SCC).<br>
        He was super friendly and gave me lots of compliments such as:<br>
        "you used nice colors" or "the menu Is super nice." But he also gave me usefull<br>
        advice like: "Make sure u are aware how you use your spacing" <br>
        and "Be aware that your logo Is't too big". I also got feedback<br>
        from Polly(teacher assistend). She really liked my poster and also my menu just as Hugo.<br>
        she did say that could add a Static navbar Instead one that stayed at the top.<br>
        I chose not to add the static navbar because Is didn't see the value In It while<br>
        my webside Isn't that big. Not only did I get advice from my teachers but also from my fellow students.<br>
        A piece of really helpfull advice that I got was from a student named Lochlan<br>
        he told me that I should probably change the color of the links<br>
        In my website. The color of the links where previously purple but<br>
        I changed them to dark blue sindce you could see them better that way.
