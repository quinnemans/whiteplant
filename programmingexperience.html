      <th class="faq"> There is not to much i can tell you about my previous experience with programming but i will tell
        you either way.
        about one year ago i was still in my final year of my secundary school and did actually have IT classes. We
        started our IT classes with
        building our own website using notepad++, HTML and CSS. We had about 3 months to build our own webiste with
        topic of choice before we started
        with phyton. We used phyton for about 2 months or so for al kinds of little assignments, secretly i hoped we
        would do more with Phyton but
        unfortunatly we never did. After Phyton we moved on to Aurdino where we had to write code for lighting up
        lightbulbs or making a sonar sensor using
        the bredboard. So thats basicly the programming ecperience that i have,just as i said it isn't anything special.
        My previous experience is slightly
        giving me an advantage at the moment because we are making a website with HTML again and that is somethinig i
        have already done once. So basicly with
        this project i have a quick start but as soon as we start a new topic it is a fresh start for me.
