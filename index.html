    <h1> The HZ</h1>
     <P> The 'Hogeschool Zeeland' also known as the HZ is a school with many different courses, </P>
     <p> from computer IT to construction, there is a direction for everything you can think about. </p>
     <p> At the HZ there are about 5000 students from all over the world and therefore mainly English is spoken. </p>
     <p> Even in the international IT class this year there are already students over more than 20 different countries</P>
     <br>
     <p> The course I chose is also the IT education, but instead of the international class I chose the Dutch class.</P>
     <p> I chose this class because i think the education itself is tough enough. Not that I am not good at English,</P>
     <p> on the contrary I am quite good at it but I think I would not understand everything if it was all in English.</P>
     <p> I chose for this education because I have always been interested in computers, I love nothing more than putting computers together and apart</P>
     <p> and everything that resembles that. I also think that with this education you can go to many different directions since the world is becoming more and more modern.</P>
