<h1> Home </h1>

    <tr>
      <th><p> The 'Hogeschool Zeeland' also known as the HZ is a school with many different courses,
        from computer IT to construction, there is a direction for everything you can think about.
        At the HZ there are about 5000 students from all over the world and therefore mainly English is spoken. 
         Even in the international IT class this year there are already students over more than 20 different countries. </p></th>

      <th><p>The course I chose is also the IT education, but instead of the international class I chose the Dutch class.
        I chose this class because i think the education itself is tough enough. Not that I am not good at English,
        on the contrary I am quite good at it but I think I would not understand everything if it was all in English.
        I chose for this education because I have always been interested in computers, I love nothing more than putting
         computers together and apart
        and everything that resembles that. I also think that with this education you can go to many different
         directions since the world is becoming more and more modern.
